## 🚀 Project Overview


FeedFlow is a sleek feed-based web app that lets users scroll through posts, like them, save favorites, and even create or edit their own posts — all powered by localStorage for persistent data.
It combines smooth UI animations with full CRUD functionality to deliver a social media-like experience in a fully frontend-only project.
